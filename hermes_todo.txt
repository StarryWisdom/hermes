get engineering data sync working
	sending eng data before client start results in crash on select
	test ship destruction
	test sim resets
	test server restarts (remeber 2 tiers of caching)
	add gm info for how many eng data is being saved (as a paranoia check that we arent storing more than # of ships)
	add something to clear eng data packets? maybe?

some stats for total data useage from hermes (including added packets via hermes)
fix gm log message if error in gm command
logging (hermes.cpp, hermes_gm.h, hermes.h, hermes_proxy.h), logging RE debug message on TSN
update cout to new logging
threads are increasingly badly named - fix
consider make "give this client gm" an extra gm function not idle text
attempt_read in hermes_socket wants thinking about re partial reads - it looks wrong
test with multiple servers
	watcher with multiple server
		configure startup watcher (currently only connectiong to ship 0's server)
	check engineering data not synced cross server
consider spliting hermes_thread.h
log eng settings over time in gm client
add reminder RE firewall

there is some sort of data savings for merging object_bitstreams - consider doing this
